Welcome to the ftrack :term:`Python` :term:`API` documentation.

.. important::

    This is the new :term:`Python` client for the ftrack :term:`API`. It can be
    considered relatively stable and ready for production use though there may
    be missing features and a few bugs left to deal with as it approaches the
    1.0.0 release. If you are migrating from the old client then please read
    the dedicated :ref:`migration guide <release/migrating_from_old_api>`.
